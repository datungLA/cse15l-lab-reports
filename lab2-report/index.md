## Part 3
In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didnâ€™t know before.\
In week 3, I was able to learn that adding a . before the name of a file will make the file hidden. I believe this is useful to keep important files hidden preventing unwanted changes made to those files. In addition to that, the ls command can also take an argument namely -a that will show hidden files. Therefore, it is a great tool to see what is hidden.
