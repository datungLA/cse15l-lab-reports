## Methods called:
Two methods are called when the page is accessed which are method `handle` from ServerHttpHandler class and method `handleRequest` from Handler class.
## Relevant arguments:
For ServerHttpHandler.handle(...), the relevant argument is `exchange`, specifically exchange.getRequestURI() which would be http://localhost:port/add-message?s=cse15l \
For Handler.handleRequest(...), the relevant argument is `url` which would be the same as exchange.getRequestURI() from above.
## Changes:
In Handler.handleRequest(...), the num is incremented from 3 to 4.\
The str in Handler class gets appended with "4: cse15l\n".

c) A terminal interaction where you log into ieng6 with your course-specific account without being asked for a password.

# Part 3
In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didnâ€™t know before.\
In week 3, I was able to learn that adding a . before the name of a file will make the file hidden. I believe this is useful to keep important files hidden preventing unwanted changes made to those files. In addition to that, the ls command can also take an argument namely -a that will show hidden files. Therefore, it is a great tool to see what is hidden.
