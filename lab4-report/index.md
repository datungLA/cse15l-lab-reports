In this step, I first open my computer terminal and run the command below: \
`ssh cs15lfa23qt@ieng6.ucsd.edu`
## Step 5 (clone repo)

In this step, I clone the repo with SSH as shown in the command below: \
`git clone git@github.com:datungLA/lab7.git` 

## Step 6 (run test.sh)

In this step, I make sure that I am in the directory that contains the test.sh script file. However, I was at the home directory. Therefore, I run the command below to go in lab7 directory: \
`cd lab7` \
Since I am now in the right directory, I run this command to run test.sh script file: \
`bash test.sh`
## Step 7 (edit .java file to fix bug)

In this step, I simply run the command: `vim ListExamples.java` to open ListExamples.java file under vim mode as I am in the same directory as the file. \
